      The standardization of tables was a high-impact project in VC-X Sonar, considering the central 
      role tables play in the software. Implementing DataTables.js as the foundation for all tables 
      allowed for improved visual and behavioral consistency, which makes reading and understanding 
      information simpler and reduces the time and energy spent by users. Furthermore, with 
      standardization, it was possible to add well-received functionalities, such as: fixed columns, 
      better data export options, child rows (rows within rows that provide extra information), date 
      range filters, and file upload/download.

      The biggest challenge in this project was unifying over 100 tables that were previously 
      divided between two different libraries (Footable and an old version of DataTables.js) into a 
      single updated standard. The diversity of information types and table purposes required a 
      flexible architecture that could handle everything from simple lists to more complex 
      processes, such as file uploads within tables. Additionally, we had to implement tables for 
      emails using MJML, a separate process with its own technical difficulties. All this work was 
      carried out by a small team of 3 developers who were also handling other parallel demands.

      This project represented significant technical growth for me, as I achieved proficiency in 
      DataTables.js, along with progress in JavaScript and other libraries. Positive user feedback 
      validated the design decisions and functionalities. I learned to break down a complex project 
      into deliverable blocks, which allowed me to maintain quality and consistency even with 
      multiple simultaneous demands.
