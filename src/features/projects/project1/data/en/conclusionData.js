            The development of the dashboard presented considerable complexity. The decision of 
            splitting the implementation into two parts proved to be a great success. We focused on 
            one card, validated the structure and then replicated it on the other cards. We probably 
            avoided the code review from taking much longer, as many problems would be similar. 
            Thus, in the second task, less adjustments were necessary.

            My biggest challenge in this project was working with two libraries I didn't know yet, 
            ChartJs and DayJs. The period exchange of chart data is one of the most important 
            features of the dashboard, so understanding how to relate the two libraries took 
            considerable effort.

            What I liked most about this project was implementing the charts with ChartJs. I'm very 
            interested in the data visualization area and I had already studied another library, D3. 
            However, I found development with ChartJs simpler and more fun, both because of the 
            structure of the library and the quality of the documentation. I intend to continue 
            studying and working with ChartJs.
