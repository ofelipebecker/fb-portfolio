      Much changed since I first designed the project, and l decided to
      take a different approach this time. Five years ago I followed
      strictly the design method, and in that context it made sense.
      Nowadays, on the other hand, my direction was to develop version one
      as quickly as possible, so I could test it in the "real" world.

      I discovered that, not surprisingly, map services are much easier to
      work with, as well as much more available. Having tools such as
      Mapbox and OpenStreetMap, made the project possible.

      On developing technologies, my first intent was to develop a mobile
      app with React Native. I realized while trying, that would take too
      much time for me to adapt everything to React Native, as I had only
      basic development knowledge. I decided that it was better to make a
      simpler but quicker version - a vanilla JS web app, and then test
      the project.

      It was great to finally have the project I worked so hard to design
      becoming real, but also I learned a lot about web development and
      map design, and It made me a more skilled and confident
      professional.
