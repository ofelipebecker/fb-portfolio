    Cities & Bikes is an interactive cycling map of Florianópolis
    (Brazil) and neighboring cities. Its' goal is to provide information
    about the cycling infrastructure in the region, such as cycleways,
    along with handy places, like workshops. My hole was researching,
    designing, and developing. I had already worked on this project some
    years ago, without being able to develop at that moment. Thus, my
    goal here was to update the project design and to develop it.
